*NAIVE BAYES*
* to understand Naive Bayes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2L2Uv9pdDA&ab_channel=StatQuestwithJoshStarmer
-the probability of discrete = likelihood
-naive Bayes has high bias because it ignores relationships betwwen words
but it works well in practice, it has low variance

log to avoid underflow

* to understand Cross Validation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSytzGwwBVw&ab_channel=StatQuestwithJoshStarmer

remarks:
-bias fel train data wel variance fel test data
-(knn)high k high bias low variance
-(knn) higher K lower complexity

Neural network can either be supervised or unsupervised.
Deep learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.
Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.
